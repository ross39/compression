Bloom Filters are a type of space-efficient probabilistic data structure that can be used to test whether an element is a member of a set. That is when the Bloom Filter is queried 'does this element exist in the set?' and the Bloom Filter returns 'yes' when in fact the element does not exist in the set. We accept these false positives as by agreeing to occasionally get a false positive, we gain an enormous space advantage versus had we refused to accept a false positive. Using mathematics we can know in advance our false positive rate and tune the bloom filter accordingly. Namely, by setting the size of our bit array to $\frac{K}{S}\ln(2)$ we can reduce the false positive rate of the bloom filter to $2^{-K}$, which is optimal. Given a maximum, allowed false positive rate, r, finding the optimal (minimal) value for k is easy. By assumption k is integral, which makes it difficult to tune a Bloom filter when the desired false positive rate is almost of the form $2^{-k}$. This thesis is about relaxing the integrality assumption and using the result to investigate applications for video compression.
